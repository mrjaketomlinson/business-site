This project is an example business website, which is currently hosted on Heroku: [example-business-site.herokuapp.com](example-business-site.herokuapp.com). The project uses [React-Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) to create a multipage site that allows a user to go from page to page. Each page is rather simple, but showcases different things you might find on a business website. This project also uses [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) on the "Contact" page.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
